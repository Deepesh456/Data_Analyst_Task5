# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and family relationships.

## Introduction

The project begins with detailed data exploration to uncover patterns and trends in the data. After cleaning and transforming the dataset, a Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict survival outcomes for unseen passengers.

## Included Files

- titanic.py  
  Contains the full workflow for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

- train.csv  
  Training dataset containing passenger features and survival labels.

- test.csv  
  Test dataset containing passenger features for which survival predictions were made.

- submission.csv  
  Contains predicted survival outcomes generated by the trained model for the test dataset.

## Approach

### Data Exploration

- Used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze distributions, relationships, and identify missing values.
- Explored how features such as gender, passenger class, and age influenced survival.

### Data Cleaning

- Filled missing values using median and mode imputation.
- Removed columns with excessive missing data such as Cabin.
- Encoded categorical variables like Sex, Embarked, and Title.

### Feature Engineering

- Extracted titles (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) from the Name column and grouped rare titles.
- Created a new feature FamilySize using SibSp and Parch.

### Model Training

- Trained a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn.
- Split the training data into 80% training and 20% validation.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### Prediction

- Used the trained model to predict survival on the test dataset.
- Saved the output as submission.csv in the required format.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Instructions for Running

1. Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

   pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

2. Place the following files in the working directory:

   - train.csv
   - test.csv

3. Run the script:

   python titanic.py

4. submission.csv will be generated with predicted survival values.
